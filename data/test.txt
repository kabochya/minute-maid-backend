Okay well let's get rolling shall we know was shift starts at five so we don't have all day. Now we're all clear on the ground rules right now shore that up. Okay so we need to come up with some ideas on how we can be **** sales and get more customers through the door. Any and all ideas welcome at this stage. Well here's a big one i think. We don't currently have any kind of loyalty program for example maybe we have people sign up online and then we send them coupons. I think a loyalty program could work really well. Okay loyalty program good let me get some of that up here. I'm just to add to what noah said about the whole online idea. I think we really under utilize social media. I mean we've got quite a few friends on facebook and a ton of twitter followers. But we haven't really leverage those relationships. Yeah that's true and there are companies out there that can help us generate buzz. Right social media great stuff anyone else. Talking about relationships and such one idea might be a partner more with other merchants in the area. Okay could you be a bit more specific eric. Kind of thing you have in mind. Well i think about the salon next door. They want to provide a complete experience for their customers right. Well. They could be serving our coffee and other stuff too. Okay so partnering with other merchants. So just to keep our scope clear here that's not exactly about increasing in store sales and my right there. Not directly no but indirectly for sure. Those customers and it's not just the salon but it's all the other shops around here too. If their customers have a chance to try our products than many would make their way in later. Okay i see what you're saying great ideas so far. Let's see what else we can come up with here. And melissa you have something.
