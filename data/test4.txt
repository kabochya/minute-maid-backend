Fantastic. So what's next here. Number four is pr activities. That means white paper local media stuff and taking care of press releases for our new services. Excuse me carlos. Number five is new brochures so four and five both involve a lot of writing. Maybe they can be lumped together and one person could see everything through. Yeah good idea. And marion i'm going to assign responsibility for these to you. You're the strongest writer by far. Okay costs i'm happy to take on that role. Great stuff. Then please report back to meet each step. I just want to make sure we're on message with everything. Sure thing. Okay. Next year. Let's take a look at setting up a new crm. That's a biggie. A major part of pushing this plan forward. But i know it's really going to help us track progress over all. Alright carlos i think that's in my wheelhouse. I'm actually really looking forward to having that. Me too. But i am just a bit concerned about whether we can stick to the time line on that. In our final meeting with the consultant i know we decided to get the crm up and running by august. But summer is usually so busy for us. I'm thinking maybe we should push it back by at least a month. I'll second that. You'll probably need some support from me with this. And i think it'll be difficult for me to stay on track with everything else if i'm trouble shooting a new c. r. m. over the summer. I hear what you're saying but my concern is that if we delay things will end up not following through on some of this. Strategy is ninety percent execution as they say. True enough. But we've still got a couple more things on the list like market research and customer surveys. I think our original timeline is maybe a bit too ambitious to get everything completed before the end of summer.
