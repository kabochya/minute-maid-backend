Alright so i think bridge consulting did a bang up job for us on this marketing framework but implementing the plan is going to be the real work. Yeah i'm with you on that we have to translate this into action. Exactly and we've got a rough time line but now we need to decide who's going to do what. There are twelve action items here. So everyone will have a part to play. Let's start right at the top with revising the website. Anyone want to take the lead on this. Just so we're clear carlos and looking ahead to the other actions. You mean someone to see things through on all aspects of the website. That would include not just point one but also points to in three. Collecting feedback on the site and managing online reviews. Or were you thinking separate people would carry out each action. If i can jump in i'd say that if we're working towards a better web presence overall it would be more consistent if one person handles everything. Agreed it's best if one person takes ownership of all three. It might involve a couple of people doing the work but we need a lead. Fair enough. And so is that something you'd like to sign up for byron you've got the right skill set for it. Yeah alright i'm game. I'm thinking that there's a lot to do here so as long as i can delegate some tasks along the way i'm good. I'm certainly willing to help out on the website. Great then i think it's especially important that all the website stuff happens in a timely manner. We might have to flex the timeline in some places. But we need to stick to it as closely as possible. You bet. So i'd like to follow up with you three weeks from today and see the results of the feedback and your proposed revisions. No problem carlos. I'm going to block out time for collecting feedback next week. And then marion and i will come up with some ideas. Fantastic. So what's next year. Number four is pr activities. That means white paper local media stuff. And taking care of press releases for our new services.
